An (incomplete) formalization of residual theory in Agda, following the work of Lévy, Huet, and Melliès.  

The modules should be read in the following order:

--

Utils
  Auxiliary, generic, functions.

AxiomaticRewriteSystem
  Definition of the structure of an axiomatic rewriting system.

SetOfSteps
  Definition of the type of finite sets of coinitial steps.

Developments
  Definition of development.

BoundedDevelopments
  Proof of various results that hold in any axiomatic rewriting system,
  asumming a strong version of the Finite Developments theorem.

WeakEquivalence
  Definition of a notion of weak equivalence between derivations.

Permutation
  Definition of the notion of permutation equivalence between derivations.

Multiderivations
  [incomplete]
